This project was done for the third semester, in the second year of my Bachelor of Engineering degree in Computer Engineering.

Features: 
- Allows for basic arithmetic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplcation and division for two numbers from the various popular number systems.
- The same operands and result can be converted and viewed in the other number systems.
- Different calculations can be easily done on the same two operands; switching between operations and number systems has been developed to be convenient.
- Basic interface made with Java Swing.
